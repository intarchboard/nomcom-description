# The IAB Role

The IAB is chartered both as a committee of the IETF and as an advisory body of the
Internet Society.
The IAB acts as a source of advice and guidance concerning technical, architectural and
procedural matters pertaining to the Internet and its enabling technologies;
this includes both reviewing proposed new work and providing input to the IESG as well as
providing perspective to the broader community on important issues.

The IAB develops and documents architectural insight and guidance for the Internet.
It provides architectural input into IETF technical activities as well as sponsoring and
organizing work in the IRTF. The IAB also has several procedural roles to support the
operation of the IETF including being the formal channel for liaisons with other
organizations.

## Organizational role

The IAB has a number of roles within the organizational functioning of the IETF. While
these roles require administrative rather than technical work, they form a large and
important part of the IABs activities.
All IAB members need to be prepared to participate (to varying degrees) in these
activities.

The IAB serves as an appeal board for complaints of improper execution of the standards
process, acting on appeals in respect of IESG standards decisions.
In addition, the IAB appoints ISOC BoT members as well as a member of the IAOC, and hears
appeals on matters related to the IAOC and IAD.

The IAB is responsible for the RFC Editor function, including appointing and overseeing
the RFC Series Editor.
The IAB provides direction for the administration of the IETF's protocol parameters
registries (the IANA function).
The IAB selects the chair of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) for a renewable two
year term, and oversees the IRTF's activities.

The IAB has a role in the IETF Nominations Committee process:
the IAB confirms the IETF Chair and the Area Directors (IESG).

The IAB is responsible for liaisons between the IETF and other organizations that
undertake activities that overlap or intersect with the IETF's activities including other
standards development organizations.
The IAB appoints liaison managers to manage these relationships, and deals with liaison
matters of an architectural or general procedural nature.
The IAB becomes actively involved when these liaison relationships have difficulties, for
example, in determining clear boundaries of responsibility.
The IAB also appoints a member to the ICANN Nomcom and a liaison to the ICANN board to
represent the IETF's interests within ICANN. IAB members fulfill the role of liaison
"shepherds" to advise the liaison managers and to act as review point for assessing the
efficacy of liaison activities and the liaison manager's duties.

## Architectural role

The IAB oversees various aspects of the architecture for the protocols and technical
specifications as developed by the IETF, as well as overseeing activities in the IRTF.
While the IAB does draw on specific expertise as required, it is expected that the sum of
the expertise of IAB members encompasses a broad range of technologies under IETF and IRTF
study, and also encompasses a broad range of perspectives on these specifications, from
research and academic study through development, deployment and operational experience.

A major role of the IAB is to take a broad and long range perspective to offer input into
the planning and coordination among different areas of Internet activities, including
those of the IETF and IRTF. The IAB, both collectively and on an individual basis, is
expected to pay attention to important long- term issues in the Internet, to make sure
that these issues are brought to the attention of the groups that are in a position to
address them, and to make sure that the right people within these groups are in contact
with each other.

To foster this community-building role, the IAB maintains open communications channels
with other bodies engaged in Internet governance, including ICANN, the Regional Internet
Registries, and ISOC, and provides technical and architectural input as appropriate.
As needed, the IAB works with ISOC to provide advice and guidance to the Internet
community on technical, architectural, procedural, and policy matters pertaining to the
Internet and its enabling technologies.
That advice and guidance are provided to the public, to the Board of Trustees and Officers
of the Internet Society, and to the larger community as circumstances dictate.

# IAB Organization

In order to enhance institutional memory and enable the development of medium and long
term activities, the IAB has organized its work in several areas in the form of programs.
A program is a high priority, long term activity scoped and managed by the IAB, which can
be thought of as an IAB directorate, small task force, or an ad-hoc body of (independent)
technical experts (see RFC 2850 Section 2.1).

Program outputs include IAB documents and statements.
All IAB members are expected to review and comment on program outputs that represent the
consensus of the IAB. In order to ensure that all IAB activities have IAB participation,
members of the IAB are expected to actively participate in one or more programs.

The program leads, who will usually be IAB members, communicate the program plan to the
community, solicit feedback, facilitate activities within the program, provide oversight
and ensure continuity.
The program lead will typically nominate non-IAB members to the program, subject to IAB
approval, will develop the program plan, will organize regular program conference calls,
and will develop consensus within the program for recommendations to be made to the IAB.
The lead doesnâ€™t need to have specific expertise in the area, but must have good general
understanding of the issues from technical, business, and or policy perspective.

The IAB as a whole periodically reviews the state of the programs and their progress, and
makes necessary adjustments and prioritization.
This includes a review of the program membership, activity plan and progress against
deliverables. Current IAB programs include:

- IANA Evolution Program
- Internationalization Program
- IP Stack Evolution Program
- Liaison Oversight Program
- Privacy and Security Program
- Names and Identifiers Program
- IETF Protocol Registries Oversight Committee
- RFC Editor Series Oversight Committee

In addition, the IAB chooses a chair for a one year term at the March IETF meeting, after
new members of the IAB are seated.
The chair represents the IAB externally when necessary, and is an ex officio member of the
IESG and the IAOC. There shall be at least two members of the IAB (among the nominated
slate and the incumbents) who are willing and able to take the role of Chair.

# IAB Member Qualities

IAB members are expected to act at the "Board" level.

The IAB is most effective when it is composed of a diverse set of individuals with a broad
range of technical skills, architectural perspectives and backgrounds.
For example, it is desirable for IAB members to have technical leadership experience,
operational management backgrounds, research or academic backgrounds, implementation
experience, and experience in other bodies involved in Internet governance.
Likewise it is desirable for IAB members to have had experiences with differing technical
challenges and requirements, including those that vary by geographic region.
It is critical that IAB members be willing and able to work with each other to develop a
shared viewpoint.

Some IAB activities are very specialized - for example, managing liaison relationships
with other SDOs on behalf of the IETF. It is advantageous for the IAB when NomCom ensures
that at least some IAB members have sufficient managerial skills to understand the issues
that need to come to the IAB by managing and documenting inter-SDO liaison relationships
on a strategic basis.

While it is advantageous for at least some IAB membership to have expertise in the IAB's
current program topics, it is more important for the IAB to have membership who are
experienced in managing volunteer teams, and who can build teams, motivate program work,
and direct one or more programs even in the absence of in-depth knowledge about specific
program topics.
The IAB needs at least some members with program management skills that will facilitate
interfacing between programs and the IAB.

IAB members...

- are highly regarded in one or more domains of technical subject matter.
  They may be recognized in a particular area as being a domain expert, but also exhibit
  advanced architectural and technical competence.
- are willing and able to apply those technical skills and analytic thinking to understand
  and usefully contribute to discussions in other areas and to have interests broad enough
  that they are willing and able to contribute to discussions on new areas as appropriate.
- are willing and able to apply their managerial skills to new areas.
- are willing and able to make introductions among their networks of technical experts in
  support of the IAB's community-building role.
- are constructive in framing new approaches, technically or in terms of communication.
- are willing and able to work well with others.
- are willing and able to constructively contribute to consensus-based processes.
- have substantial experience within the IETF, and an understanding of its processes and
  workings.
- are willing and able to commit the time to follow IAB, IRTF and IETF discussions on a
  regular basis.
  This commitment should extend to regular attendance at IAB teleconferences and attendance
  in person at IETF meetings, IAB workshops, an annual IAB retreat, as well as the
  commitment to review material and generate and edit documentation.
  This may also extend to leading open discussion forums and active participation in IETF WG
  and IRTF RG activities.

# Time Commitment

The time commitment for an IAB member averages about eight to sixteen hours a week in
normal weeks, and full-time during IETF meetings, retreats, and IAB workshops.
Simply tracking the various mailing list and documents can take up to a day a week.
About a quarter to half of the time is spent on the organizational activities.
Leading a program is an equivalent time commitment to chairing a working group, and active
participation in a program an equivalent time commitment to authoring one or more
documents in a working group.
Each IAB member should be able to commit to leading a program during their IAB term.

Some positions within the IAB require more time.
The typical time commitment for the IAB Chair is three days a week, and this position may
require more travel.
The IAB Chair is an ex officio member of the IESG and the IAOC, as well, and must devote
time to the meetings of these organizations.

Note that the while the IAB Chair is currently an ex officio member of the IAOC per RFC
4071, this may change in the near future to allow the IAB to appoint a member whose skills
are better matched to the IAOC (see draft-hardie-iaoc-iab-update).
If this is the case, this appointed member will also have to devote time to the IAOC.

IAB members may be tapped by ADs to do reviews of specialized documents and other tasks,
potentially adding to those numbers.
IAB members should plan to arrive at IETF meetings on the Saturday preceding the meeting.
Time commitment during the meeting includes time on Sunday, early mornings during the
week, Friday afternoons, as well as coverage of BoFs during the meeting for technical and
architectural review.

An annual retreat will be scheduled for up to three days in late April or early May.

The IAB schedules workshops on topics of interest from time to time, and IAB members are
encouraged to attend these as well.
